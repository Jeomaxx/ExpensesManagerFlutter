# Security Implementation Notes

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING ⚠️

This application currently contains **PLACEHOLDER AUTHENTICATION** that is **NOT SECURE** and **NOT PRODUCTION-READY**.

### Current Security Issues

1. **No Password Verification**: The sign-in process currently ignores passwords completely
2. **No Password Storage**: Passwords are not hashed or stored securely
3. **Mock Authentication**: Authentication is simulated for demonstration purposes only

### Required for Production

Before deploying this application to production, you MUST:

1. **Implement Real Authentication**:
   - Use Firebase Authentication or another secure provider
   - Implement proper password hashing (bcrypt, scrypt, etc.)
   - Add proper session management
   - Implement secure token storage

2. **Database Security**:
   - Add encryption for sensitive financial data
   - Use SQLCipher or similar for local database encryption
   - Implement proper data access controls

3. **Network Security**:
   - Use HTTPS for all API communications
   - Implement certificate pinning
   - Add request/response encryption for sensitive data

4. **Local Storage Security**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data before storing locally
   - Use secure storage for API keys and tokens
   - Implement app-level lock/biometric authentication

### Demo Purpose Only

The current implementation is for **DEMONSTRATION and DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES ONLY** and should never be used with real financial data or in a production environment.

### Next Steps

1. Configure Firebase Authentication properly
2. Implement password hashing and verification
3. Add proper session management
4. Implement data encryption
5. Add comprehensive security testing
6. Conduct security audit before production deployment
