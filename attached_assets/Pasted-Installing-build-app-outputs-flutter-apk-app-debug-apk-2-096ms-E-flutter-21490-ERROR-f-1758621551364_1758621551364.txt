══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The following assertion was thrown during performLayout():
RenderFlex children have non-zero flex but incoming width constraints are unbounded.
When a row is in a parent that does not provide a finite width constraint, for example if it is in a
horizontal scrollable, it will try to shrink-wrap its children along the horizontal axis. Setting a
flex on a child (e.g. using Expanded) indicates that the child is to expand to fill the remaining
space in the horizontal direction.
These two directives are mutually exclusive. If a parent is to shrink-wrap its child, the child
cannot simultaneously expand to fit its parent.
Consider setting mainAxisSize to MainAxisSize.min and using FlexFit.loose fits for the flexible
children (using Flexible rather than Expanded). This will allow the flexible children to size
themselves to less than the infinite remaining space they would otherwise be forced to take, and
then will cause the RenderFlex to shrink-wrap the children rather than expanding to fit the maximum
constraints provided by the parent.
If this message did not help you determine the problem, consider using debugDumpRenderTree():
  https://flutter.dev/to/debug-render-layer
  https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/debugDumpRenderTree.html
The affected RenderFlex is:
  RenderFlex#8729e relayoutBoundary=up7 NEEDS-LAYOUT NEEDS-PAINT NEEDS-COMPOSITING-BITS-UPDATE(creator: Row ← Align ← ConstrainedBox ← Semantics ← DropdownMenuItem<String> ← IgnorePointer ← _Visibility ← _VisibilityScope ←
  Visibility ← _RawIndexedStack ← IndexedStack ← Row ← ⋯, parentData: offset=Offset(0.0, 0.0) (can use size), constraints: BoxConstraints(0.0<=w<=Infinity, 0.0<=h<=24.0), size: MISSING, direction: horizontal, mainAxisAlignment:     
  start, mainAxisSize: max, crossAxisAlignment: center, textDirection: rtl, verticalDirection: down, spacing: 0.0)
The creator information is set to:
  Row ← Align ← ConstrainedBox ← Semantics ← DropdownMenuItem<String> ← IgnorePointer ← _Visibility
  ← _VisibilityScope ← Visibility ← _RawIndexedStack ← IndexedStack ← Row ← ⋯
The nearest ancestor providing an unbounded width constraint is: RenderFlex#3d1fb NEEDS-LAYOUT NEEDS-PAINT NEEDS-COMPOSITING-BITS-UPDATE:
  creator: Row ← Padding ← SizedBox ← DefaultTextStyle ← _Decorator ← InputDecorator ← Listener ←
    _GestureSemantics ← RawGestureDetector ← GestureDetector ← MouseRegion ← Semantics ← ⋯

  mainAxisAlignment: spaceBetween
  mainAxisSize: min
  crossAxisAlignment: center
